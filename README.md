AIM: To study and implement Python Set data structure by performing basic operations.

Theory: In Python, a set is a built-in data type used to store a collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate values and are unordered in nature. They are useful for performing mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Elements can be added using add() and removed using remove() or discard(). Python also provides an immutable version of set known as frozenset, which cannot be modified after creation. Sets help in fast membership testing and removing repeated elements from a list.

--->Algorithm for Problem Statement 1: Remove duplicate participants using set

Start the program

Create a list named registered_participants with participant names (including duplicates)

Convert the list into a set using set() to remove duplicate entries

Store the result in unique_participants

Print the original list of registered participants

Print the set of unique participants

Stop the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--->Algorithm for Problem Statement 2: Find common subjects using set intersection

Start the program

Create three sets named stud1_subjects, stud2_subjects, and stud3_subjects containing subjects chosen by three students

Find the common elements among the three sets using intersection operator &

Store the result in common_subjects

Display the subjects of Student 1

Display the subjects of Student 2

Display the subjects of Student 3

Display the common subjects chosen by all students

Stop the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--->Algorithm for Problem Statement 3: Find students in both clubs and in only one club using sets

Start the program

Create a set named cricket_club containing students of the Cricket Club

Create another set named football_club containing students of the Football Club

Display both sets

Find students present in both clubs using intersection() method

Store the result in students_in_both_clubs

Display the students in both clubs

Find students present in only one club using symmetric_difference() method

Store the result in students_in_only_one_club

Display the students in only one club

Stop the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--->Algorithm for problem statement 4: Find absent students using set difference

Start the program

Create a set named all_students containing names of all students

Create another set named present_students containing names of present students

Find absent students by subtracting present_students from all_students using set difference -

Store the result in absent_students

Display the set of all students

Display the set of present students

Display the set of absent students

Stop the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--->Algorithm for problem statement 5: Remove a course from a set using discard()

Start the program

Create a set named courses containing course codes

Display all courses

Remove the course "ETC102" from the set using discard() method

Display the updated set of courses

Stop the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION: In this experiment, we successfully studied and implemented the Python Set data structure. We learned how to create sets, remove duplicate elements, add and delete items, and perform various set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. We also understood the use of discard() method and the concept of frozenset. From this experiment, it is clear that sets are very useful for handling unique data and performing mathematical operations efficiently in Python.
